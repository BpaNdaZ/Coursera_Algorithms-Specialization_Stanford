**Week2_Counting Inversions**

Use the merge sort paradim to solve this problem
- divide and conquer, solve the original problem by recursively merge sort the sub-sequences and counting the inversions @ the same time
- detailes are shown in the Week2_CountingInversions.py
- there is also a Week2_1_CountingInversions.py which is faster than Week2_CountingInversions.py, however I dunno why...(hope someone could show me how)
