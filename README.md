# Coursera_Algorithms_Specialization-Stanford

This project contains all the codes that i wrote when I took the ***Algorithms Specialization by Stanford*** on Coursera which is instructed by Tim Roughgarden professor.

All the things, including Python, programming, and algorithms, that I learned are self taught, please let me know if there is anything in this project you think is wrong or can be improved.
