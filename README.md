# Coursera_Algorithms-Specialization_Stanford

This project contains all the codes that i wrote when I took the ***Algorithms Specialization by Stanford*** on Coursera which is instructed by Tim Roughgarden professor.

All the things, including Python, programming, and algorithms, that I learned are self taught, please let me know if there is anything in this project you think is wrong or can be improved.


## Course1_Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms


**Week1_Karatsuba Algorithm**

Karatsuba algorithm uses 3 multiplications other than 4 multiplications in the classic multiplication algorithm
- divide and conquer, solve the original problem by recursively solving the sub-problems.
- care about the negative numbers, if there are any.
- solution coded as Week1_KaratsubaAlgorithm.py


**Week2_Counting Inversions**

Use the merge sort paradim to solve this problem
- divide and conquer, solve the original problem by recursively merge sort the sub-sequences and counting the inversions @ the same time
- detailes are shown in the Week2_CountingInversions.py
- there is also a Week2_1_CountingInversions.py which is faster than Week2_CountingInversions.py, however I dunno why...(hope someone could show me how)
